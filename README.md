Sign Language Recognition (Team size: 3)                                                                                                       Jan 2023 - May 2023
•	Engineered a sign language recognition model that translates gestures into textual output (Alphabets), enhancing accessibility in communication.
•	Leveraged advanced computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and MediaPipe for effective hand tracking, image enhancement, and noise reduction during the preprocessing phase
•	Employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and gesture classification, utilizing shape and movement analysis to achieve high recognition accuracy.
